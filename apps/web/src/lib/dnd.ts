// phones per-draggable via `useDraggable({ disabled })` (see useIsPhone), not by
// dropping sensors here — dnd-kit puts the sensors in a useEffect dependency
// array and warns if its length changes between renders.
//
// `inert` returns empty sensors so no drag can ever start, used by a read-only
// share: the board keeps its DndContext (cards call useDraggable/useDroppable and
